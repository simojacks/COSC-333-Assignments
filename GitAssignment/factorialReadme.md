This is a simple C++ program to calculate the factorial of a given number using recursion. The program also measures and displays the runtime of the factorial calculation.

## Features
- Calculates the factorial of a non-negative integer.
- Measures and displays the runtime of the factorial computation in microseconds.
- Handles invalid inputs (e.g., negative numbers).

OUTPUT EXAMPLES

Input: 5

Enter a positive integer: 5
Factorial of 5 is 120
Time taken by function: 2 microseconds



Input: 10

Enter a positive integer: 10
Factorial of 10 is 3628800
Time taken by function: 3 microseconds
