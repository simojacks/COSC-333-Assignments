# Fibonacci Sequence in C++

This program calculates the Fibonacci sequence using both recursive and iterative approaches. It also measures and compares the runtime of both methods.

## Features
- Recursive Fibonacci calculation.
- Iterative Fibonacci calculation.
- Runtime measurement in microseconds.


OUTPUT EXAMPLES
INPUT: 20
Enter a positive integer (n): 20
Fibonacci (Recursive) of 20 is 6765
Time taken (Recursive): 1200 microseconds
Fibonacci (Iterative) of 20 is 6765
Time taken (Iterative): 1 microseconds

INPUT: 10
Enter a positive integer (n): 10
Fibonacci (Recursive) of 10 is 55
Time taken (Recursive): 15 microseconds
Fibonacci (Iterative) of 10 is 55
Time taken (Iterative): 1 microseconds
